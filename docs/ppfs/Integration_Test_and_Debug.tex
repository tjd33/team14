\section{Integration, Test, and Debug}

Testing will be a crucial part of the design process, as it will determine whether the system that meets the requirements 
The sensors will be tested to make sure they are sensitive enough to detect the vibrations of functioning equipment.  To do this, single sensors will be installed on Calvin Gym equipment and the output from the sensors will determine whether they are sensitive enough. This test will also determine whether the physical connection of the sensor to the equipment is sufficient to endure normal use.
The display interfaces will be tested to determine whether all the required information can be displayed while maintaining good visibility from a distance of about 7’. This will be accomplished by a simple visual check. Tests will single units on actual equipment will also be done to verify the physical connection to gym equipment. The displays will be user tested to determine their ease of use and intuitiveness.
Both the sensors and the displays will be tested for battery life. This will be done by measuring by recording the battery level of each type of device after running for one week which will allow a good estimate of the total battery life of the device to be made.
The network shall be tested to verify that all devices communicate properly and that the mesh network is working as expected. Multiple devices will be activated one at a time, each should connect to the network rapidly without disrupting the other devices’ connection. Devices shall be added outside the range of the central hub with intermediate devices in between to verify that the devices are properly forming a mesh network. No data transmitted over this network should be corrupted.
The hub and server will be tested to make sure that information is properly propagated between the sensors, display interfaces and the server. It should take less one minute for information to be transmitted from any device to any other device, including the server. This will be tested by stimulating the sensors and timing the response time for the server to detect the change, and by timing the response time of the displays to changes made on the server. 
The website will be tested by verifying that current usage and reservation information is received without any communication errors and is displayed to the user. Reservations made using the application should also be transmitted to the server without any errors. The website will also be user tested to determine whether its ease of use is sufficient.
All the equipment will be left running for multiple days with some artificial activity to verify that the system will work without crashing for at least 24 hours.
Once all the unit tests are completed, integration testing will be performed in order to determine that the device work properly in a real gym environment. The same devices being used across different equipment will determine the genericity of those devices. The status of the gym according the sensors shall be monitored, and regularly cross checked with actual gym usage to make sure that the gym usage information is correct.
