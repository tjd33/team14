\section{Conclusion}
Due to the lack of a similar products in the market and the ability to produce this product with relatively cheap hardware this project is feasible and will provide a useful and enhanced experience to gym users and administrators. It will be necessary for the network technology used for the sensors and display to be a mesh network to have the necessary range. The server and hub don't have any immediate problems as they will be implemented largely though software. This project contains a large amounts of software and that will likely be a point which has the potential to provide a great user experience and added functionality beyond the basic goals. Since the team has already ordered and received most of the hardware necessary for a basic implementation of a prototype, the largest part of the project ahead is writing all the software to make all the hardware work together in harmony. 

One possible future expansion on this project would be to work on the design of custom hardware to meet the specific needs required for this purpose. This aspect may be explored more if there is adequate time towards the end of the project, once the necessary goals have been accomplished. There could be other ways of implementing a system that accomplishes the goals of this project, such as the initial idea of using a camera to visually analyze and determine use, there could be ways to also accomplish the goals simply using the gym users smart phone. However sensors and the IoT is a rapidly growing industry and the method of implementation chosen takes advantage of many technological devices and advances currently available in the market.
