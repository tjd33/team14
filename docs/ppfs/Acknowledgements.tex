\section{Acknowledgements}

As a team, we would like to thanks the professors of the Engr 339 class and especially Professor Michmerhuizen as our advisor, for guiding us in this class, for providing insight into our project. We would also like to thanks the TI vendors for their helpfulness in working with us to acquire the components we need.

We would like to thanks the friends and family that have given us ideas and encouraged us, and especially the wives of two of our members for putting up with the time commitment of their husbands to this project.
