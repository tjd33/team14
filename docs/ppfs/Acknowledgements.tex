\section{Acknowledgements}

Team 14 would like to thank the professors of the Engineering 339 class and especially Professor Michmerhuizen as our advisor for guiding us in this class and for providing insight into our project. We also want to thank our industrial advisor, Mr. Walstra, for his excellent insight and ideas.

We are thankful to Bob DeKraker and the Texas Instruments vendors for their helpfulness in working with us to acquire the components we need.

We would like to thank the friends and family that have given us ideas and encouraged us, especially the wives of two of our members for putting up with the time commitment of their husbands to this project.
