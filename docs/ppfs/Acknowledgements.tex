\section{Acknowledgements}

Team 14 would like to thank the professors of the Engineering 339/340 class and especially Professor Michmerhuizen as our advisor for guiding us in this class and for providing insight into our project. We also want to thank our industrial advisor, Eric Walstra, for his excellent insight and ideas, and Roy Zuidema, the director of Campus Wellness at Calvin College, for his insight.

We are thankful to Bob DeKraker and the Texas Instruments vendors for their helpfulness in working with us to acquire the components we need, and we are thankful for additional funding from the Eric DeGroot Engineering Fund.

We would like to thank the friends and family that have given us ideas and encouraged us, especially the wives of two of our members for putting up with the time commitment of their husbands to this project.
