        \subsubsection{Development}
        The vast majority of the budget for this project is used for purchasing sensors and equipment for the display interfaces. The items purchased or planned to be purchased are shown in Table 1.
        \begin{table}[h!]

        The Raspberry Pi used for the hub is a model B+ owned by the Calvin engineering dept that has been borrowed for the duration of the project. A ZigBee wire antenna for the Raspberry Pi was also borrowed from the Calvin engineering department. These items and their values are shown in Table 2.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
        	\begin{center}

        			\hline
        			ZigBee Mesh Wire Antenna & \$27 \\
        			\hline
        			& \$57\\
        			\hline
        		\end{tabular}
        	\end{center}
        \end{table}
        \subsubsection{Production}
        
        In order to transition from the prototype developed in this project to a final product, it is estimated that about 200 hours or additional design time would be required. At at \$100/hour, this would cost about \$20000. The total development budget to get an initial commercial product would be about \$25000. This price should be recovered over the first five year of production, so \%5000/year.
        
        It is estimated that the system could be sold to about 100 gyms annually. A typical gym might have about 20 pieces of gym equipment that could be equipped with our sensors and displays, which would lead to a total sales of 2000 display interfaces (with sensors built in), 100 hubs, 100 servers. 
        For the prototype, a TI SensorTag is used for the sensor and display interface which has many more sensors than needed or desired and also comes with multiple wireless communication methods. It is estimated that a board without the extraneous features, and with a small case would cost about \$20.
        For the hub, the final product would likely still use a Raspberry PI as creating a custom board would be complex and likely not any cheaper. Equipment such as an Ethernet cable will still be needed.
        These part costs are shown in Table 3.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
        	\begin{center}
        		\caption{Parts cost for one system}
        		%\label{tab:table1}
        		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        			\hline
        			Quantity & Part & Price per Unit & Total\\
        			\hline
        			20 & Display Interface & \$20 & \$400\\
        			\hline
        			20 & 2.7" Memory LCD & \$18.63 \cite{mouserMemoryLCD} & \$372.6\\
        			\hline
        			1 & Raspberry Pi Model B & \$35 \cite{alliedRaspberryPi} & \$35\\
        			\hline
        			1 & XBee & \$19 \cite{mouserXBEE} & \$19\\
        			\hline
        			1 & 50' Ethernet cable & \$5.25 \cite{amazonEthernetCable} & \$5.25\\
        			\hline
        			&Total&& \$831.85\\
        			\hline
        		\end{tabular}
        	\end{center}
        \end{table}
        
        The cost of these parts does not include shipping and parts loss, so an extra 10\% is added to the parts price as overhead. 
        Over a total of 100 system, the annual initial R\&D cost recovery is \$500 per system.
        Cloud Server services such as amazon server will be used for hosting the server. This cost will be a monthly cost, and will scale with how much usage it gets. For typical usage which might be similar to a moderately WordPress installation, a 3-year instance on a small server could cost \$17.95, or \$646.2 for three years \cite{wordPressEstimate}
        For other services such as accounting, marketing, facilities, further R\&D, an additional overhead of 40\% is added to the cost.
        Theses costs along with an estimated sales price and profit are shown in table 4. The income tax rate applied is \%35.
        
        \begin{table}[h!]
        	\begin{center}
        		\caption{Cost of one System}
        		%\label{tab:table1}
        		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

        			\hline
        			Year of Server usage & \$646.2\\
        			\hline
        			Total & \$2063\\
        			\hline
        			Total with Overhead & 2888\$\\
        			\hline
        			Sales Price& \$3500\\
        			\hline
        			Profit before Tax& \$612\\
        			\hline
        			Profit after Tax& \$398\\
        			\hline
        		\end{tabular}
        	\end{center}
        \end{table}
        
        The resulting profit of \$398 results in a profit margin of 11.3\%, which is satisfactory the this project.
