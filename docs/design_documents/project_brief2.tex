\section{Project Description}

Create a system that will allow people, both clients and administrators, to interact with gyms in a modern and smart way. This system will allow users to view what machines are currently open, and it will also allow users to reserve systems for personal use. The system will also provide gym administrators with the ability to understand more clearly what machines get used, along with how often and when they are used.

\section{Current Project Status}	

The team is currently working on developing the four major hardware requirement areas outlined in section 3.2. The work is as follows:

\subsection{Sensors}
The team has successfully loaded custom code on the TI SensorTags and is able to read and store this output. There is currently work being done that uses signal processing to analyze the output and determine whether a machine is in use or not. The team is also able to turn off selected sensors on the SensorTag.

\subsection{Displays}
The team has received all the necessary equipment to work with the displays, as well as the displays themselves, but has not yet started working with the on-machine display development. This is primarily because it is seen as a secondary function when compared to retrieving information from the sensors. There is, however, development for displaying information for all the machines. This will be discussed more in section 5.4.

\subsection{Hub}
The team has developed a system that is able to send rudimentary information about the current status of machines from the hub to the server. It is also able to retrieve information from the server and then get the packets ready to send onward to the sensors and displays. All of the logic is abstracted out so that whatever wrinkles are found during the development of the sensors and displays will be able to be on the outside of the hub development. This has allowed this development to continue parallel to the sensor and display development.

\subsection{Server}
The server's two main goals currently have functioning prototypes. There is a database implemented that can store users, machines, and their relationships, as well as a database model that abstracts out the implementation for other services to be able to use. There is a website that is currently being implemented that interfaces with the database model to get information specified by the requirements. This has placeholders for each of the important pages, along with guidelines for what each page is required to do.

\subsection{Summary}
The team has made progress that is on schedule with what is planned for the semester. The main goals left for the team are to start connecting each of the different areas, adding functionality on the user end, and implementing the on-machine displays.
