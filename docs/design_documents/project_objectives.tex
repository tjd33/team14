\section{Introduction}

This document contains the intial objectives and requirements for \textbf{Team 14}. We have included both our expected objectives and requirements alongside our \textit{supplemental} objectives. \textit{Supplemental} objectives are denoted with italics.  


\section{Project Objectives}

Create a system that will allow people, both clients and administrators, to interact with gyms in a modern and smart way.
This system will allow users to view what machines are currently open, 
    and it will also allow users to reserve systems for personal use. 
\textit{In addition, users would be able to view their historical fitness data.}
The system will also provide gym administrators the ability to understand more clearly what machines get used,
    along with how often and when they are used.

\section{Project Requirements}

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Accessibility:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Data should be accessible via a web interface (available via mobile device and personal computer).}
        \item{Data should be accessible for gym managers (equipment data)}
        \item{Data should be accessible for personal use (fitness data)}
        \item{\textit{NFC/Bluetooth communication with mobile device for gathering fitness data}}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{User-friendly:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Sensors should not impede use of machinery or weights}
        \item{Web interface should be simple and easy to use}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{Reservation System:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{By machine, time, and user}
        \item{Rules about making reservations and cancelling them (protection against system abusers)}
        \item{Display reservation information on each machine}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{\textit{Allow user to interface with the display to edit the reservation}}
        \end{itemize}
        \item{No power supply required for reservation display or sensors}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{\textit{Ability to turn off and on sensors, displays from smart hub (to save energy)}}
        \end{itemize}
        \item{\textit{Bulk reservations (over multiple periods of time)}}
        \item{\textit{Electronic calendar integration}}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{"Real-time" updates of what machines are in use:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{“Real-time” meaning within 1 minute update}
        \item{Based on (multiple) sensors, not reservations}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{Generic:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Ability to install the system in a typical existing gym}
        \item{Transferability - ability to transfer sensors from one type of machine/equipment to another}
        \item{Ability to install on (most) any type of stationary equipment}
        \item{\textit{Ability to install on free weights, weight sets, etc.}}
        \item{\textit{Open API to connect to any existing fitness apps that we could work with}}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{General:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Ability to run for 24 consecutive hours without the system crashing}
        \item{Small enough that gyms would be willing to buy the system}
        \item{\textit{Ability for gyms to only use parts of the system}}
        \item{\textit{Ability to add or remove parts after initial setup}}
    \end{itemize}

    \item{\textbf{Central Management:}}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Smart Hub to collect data from sensors}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{Data will be collated by the Web Server}
        \end{itemize}
        \item{Web Server to manage reservation system and web interface}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item{\textit{Smart Hub will cache daily schedules for sending to the displays}}
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
